# Forge Motion

Dora-native motion planning and execution orchestration for Forge robots.

        -> actuator-facing controllers
```

The repository is a UV workspace of independently installable motion packages. Version 0.1 starts
with `forge-motion-server`; shared trajectory processing, collision checking, planning scenes, and
streaming servo packages should only be extracted when real additional consumers require them.

## Packages

- `packages/motion_server`: fresh-state validation, Forge FK/IK, joint-space time
  parameterization, parent/child Dora Action orchestration, cancel propagation, and final residual
  checking.

## Scope

Motion determines how a configured kinematic group reaches a joint or Cartesian target. It does not
contain object/manipulation semantics, hardware protocols, motor loops, or low-level
`JointCommand` generation.

See `examples/piper_fake_plant/` for the full Piper fake-plant integration smoke.

## Development

Use Python 3.12 and `uv`:

```bash
uv sync --frozen --all-groups
PYTHONPATH=src uv run pytest -q
```

`PYTHONPATH=src` exposes the vendored `forge-tool` protocol under
`src/forge_tool`; see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for its provenance. Optional
standalone executables can be built with `scripts/build_pyinstaller.sh`.
